# blender_t3d

Blender Import-Export add-on for old UnrealED .T3D files.

## Installation

Download the release .zip and install it (Preferences > Add-ons > Install...).

The importer uses [Lark](https://pypi.org/project/lark-parser/) as parser so you'll need to add that to your Blender python libs.

## Usage

The add-on adds the following menu items:

`File > Import / Export Unreal .T3D (.t3d)` to load and save .t3d files.

`Object > Export T3D to clipboard` to paste directly selected mesh(es) into the clipboard.
